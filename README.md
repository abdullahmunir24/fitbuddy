## Project Overview  

Many fitness apps today focus on only one feature — workout tracking, class booking, or gym discovery — forcing users to juggle multiple tools. **FitBuddy** provides a single, unified platform that combines all these services into one seamless experience.  

With FitBuddy, gym members, trainers, and owners can log workouts, schedule and attend classes, visualize their progress through analytics, and compare gyms nearby. The project aligns with our academic goals to design, develop, and deploy a full-stack web app within an eight-week term.
